Similar to Homework 2, the LLM did not identify any bugs in the C source files that matched the GitHub issues summarized in IssueList1. This does not prove that LLMs are incapable of detecting real-world bugs, but it does highlight practical limitations within this pipeline. Issues such as prompt fragility (frequent “Invalid JSON” responses), truncated analysis of large C files, overly generic or shallow bug reports from Microservice B, and the inherent difficulty of aligning low-level code issues with high-level GitHub issue descriptions all constrained the system. Under these conditions, the workflow was unable to extract or match any meaningful shared bugs between the source-level findings and the real issue tracker. This failure likely reflects the limitations of the experimental setup rather than the fundamental capabilities of LLMs.
