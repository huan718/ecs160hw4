It seems like LLM was not able to detect any bugs that overlapped with the real GitHub issues for the selected repository. When I ran the full Part D pipeline, Microservice A frequently was able to consistently produce valid JSON, sometimes returning either null responses or mixed text. Microservice B frequently timed out and had trouble producing bug reports from the source code. I think a big issue is the fact that these c.files are really big, hence the long time to process it. As a result, IssueList2 was essentially empty, and Microservice C found no common issues because of this. This does not necessarily mean that LLMs are incapable of detecting real bugs, but maybe under the constraints the system was not able to extract or match meaningful bug information.
