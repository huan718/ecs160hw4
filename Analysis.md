It seems like LLM was not able to detect any bugs that overlapped with the real GitHub issues for the selected repository. When I ran the full Part D pipeline, Microservice A frequently failed to consistently produce valid JSON, often returning either null responses or mixed text that the parser rejected. Microservice B also returned only empty or error responses, producing no structured bug reports from the source code. As a result, both IssueList1 and IssueList2 were essentially empty, and Microservice C correctly reported no common issues. This does not necessarily mean that LLMs are incapable of detecting real bugs, but maybe under the constraints the system was not able to extract or match meaningful bug information.
