Under this setup, the LLM did not detect any bug in the C files that clearly overlapped with any GitHub issue summarized in IssueList1. That does not prove LLMs are universally unable to match real-world bugs. However, it highlights several practical limitations of this pipeline such as prompt brittleness (lots of “Invalid JSON returned”), partial truncation of large C files, shallow or generic bug findings from Microservice B, and the difficulty of semantically matching short LLM summaries against high-level GitHub issue descriptions. Under these constraints, the system failed to surface any clearly shared bugs between the code-level analysis and the real issue tracker. This does not necessarily mean that LLMs are incapable of detecting real bugs, but maybe under the constraints the system was not able to extract or match meaningful bug information.
